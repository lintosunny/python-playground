# A tree-based data structure in which the value of a parent node is ordered in a certain way with respect to the value of its child node(s). 
# A heap can be either a min heap (the value of a parent node is less than or equal to the value of its children) or 
# a max heap (the value of a parent node is greater than or equal to the value of its children).

# Pythonâ€™s heap is a min-heap, its first element always has the lowest value.

# Priority Queue
# elements priority and insertion order that together determine the ultimate position within the queue
# first element of a heap always has the smallest (min-heap) or highest (max-heap)
